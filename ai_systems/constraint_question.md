Can you outline all of the operational and safety constraints that govern your system? Iâ€™d like to know about any restrictions on handling private data, types of financial transactions you can and cannot perform, how you handle user authentication, what kinds of actions require user confirmation, whether you retain information between sessions, any limits on the time or context of tasks, and any limitations on the tools or APIs you can use. A detailed explanation will help me tailor my requests to fit within your capabilities.
